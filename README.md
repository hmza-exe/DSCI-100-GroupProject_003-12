# Kaggle Dataset Analysis: Sleep Health and Lifestyle

This GitHub repository contains the group project completed by students at the University of British Columbia for the DSCI 100 course (Introduction to Data Science), section 003, under the guidance of Prof. Maggie Liu. The project involves an in-depth analysis of a dataset obtained from Kaggle, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.

# Project Description

This GitHub repository contains an analytical report on a sleep, health, and lifestyle dataset for different occupations, sourced from Kaggle. The project was completed as a group effort by myself and one other student from the University of British Columbia for the DSCI 100 course (Introduction to Data Science), section 003, under the guidance of Prof. Maggie Liu.

Our analysis aimed to explore potential correlations between occupations and various lifestyle and health factors. We utilized the KNN classification model to make predictions based on the dataset. The project was implemented using the R programming language within a Jupyter Notebook environment, aligning with the course's structure and format.

The primary challenges we encountered were minimal and included data cleaning (handling missing data), selecting relevant columns for our analysis, and normalizing the data for comparability. 

Looking ahead, potential improvements to the project could involve updating the report with more complex analyses to yield more concrete results and enhancing the visual presentation of the findings.
